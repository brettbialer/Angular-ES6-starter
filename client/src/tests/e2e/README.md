# src/e2e-tests

This folder is for Functional Tests only.  Functional tests, otherwise known as Acceptance Tests or UI Tests,
Functional tests exercise the application user interface in the same way that a user would, verifying the
functionality for the happy path of various user scenarios (how a user would use the application).
These user scenarios are generally closely related to acceptance criteria for one or more features.
